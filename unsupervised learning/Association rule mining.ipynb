    "\n",
    "Association rule mining is a technique used to discover interesting relationships, patterns, or associations among a set of items in large datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is commonly used in market basket analysis to identify products that are frequently purchased together by customers. The goal is to find rules that can help businesses make informed decisions, such as product placement, cross-selling, and inventory management."

    "\n",
    "### 1. **Item / Itemset**\n",
    "- **Item** → a single product or element.  \n",
    "  Example: `'milk'`, `'bread'`\n",
    "- **Itemset** → a collection of one or more items.  \n",
    "  Example: `{milk, bread}`\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. **Support**\n",
    "**Definition:** How often an itemset appears in all transactions.  \n",
    "\\[\n",
    "Support(A) = \\frac{\\text{No. of transactions containing A}}{\\text{Total transactions}}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "If `{milk, bread}` appears in 3 of 5 transactions →  \n",
    "`Support = 3/5 = 0.6`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaning:** 60% of all transactions contain both milk and bread.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### 3. **Confidence**\n",
    "**Definition:** How often items in **B** appear in transactions that contain **A**.  \n",
    "\\[\n",
    "Confidence(A \\rightarrow B) = \\frac{Support(A \\cup B)}{Support(A)}\n",
    "\\]\n",

    "**Example:**  \n",
    "If `{milk, bread}` appears in 3 transactions and `{milk, bread, butter}` in 2 →  \n",
    "`Confidence = (2/5) / (3/5) = 0.67`\n",

    "**Meaning:** When people buy milk and bread, 67% of the time they also buy butter.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Definition:** How much more likely B is bought when A is bought, compared to random chance.  \n",

    "- **< 1:** Negative correlation  \n",

    "### 5. **Leverage**\n",
    "**Definition:** Difference between observed and expected co-occurrence.  \n",

    "Higher → stronger relationship.\n",

    "**Definition:** Measures how strongly A implies B (directional).  \n",

    "Conviction(A \\rightarrow B) = \\frac{1 - Support(B)}{1 - Confidence(A \\rightarrow B)}\n",
